Hello! My name is Kaung Myat Htet or you can call me Ted.

I'm passionate about building AI solutions using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs) along with a focus on MLOps for scalable deployment.

I'm also aspiring to do research in areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Recommendation Systems.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects.
You can find some of my contributions here:
- [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) - not merged yet (waiting for approval)
- [checkstyles](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle)
