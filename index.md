I am a graduate student with the passion to develop innovative solution that could help human in their daily life.

I'm interested in building AI solutions using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs).

I'm also aspire to do research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Recommendation Systems. I will be going to study Master degree soon.

I'm open to contribute to open source projects during my free time.
